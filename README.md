# AngularJS_MVC
This is a simple Angular JS MVC app

Please run this on Chrome as it works best on Chrome.
Currently only needed to updated 1 record.
Code can run across a list of records, but I have set this to clear out all records from the array and add back one updated record.
The array is saved to local cache so that when you hit F5 it will retrieve the JSON from the cache and serve it to the input labels.
